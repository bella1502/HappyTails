## Introduction
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design a user-friendly app that makes the adoption of abandoned animals easier and more accessible. The focus is on creating an intuitive interface that guides users through finding, learning about, and adopting pets.

### Scope
This repository includes user flow diagrams, wireframes, interactive prototypes, and a design system. The project is solely focused on the UX design aspect.

## User Research
### Research Insights
We conducted user interviews and surveys to understand the needs and pain points of potential adopters. Key insights include:
- Users desire a quick and easy search process to find pets that match their preferences.
- Clear and detailed pet profiles are essential for making informed decisions.
- The adoption process should be straightforward, with minimal barriers to communication with shelters.

## Design Process
### User Flows
The user flows map the journey from app onboarding to the completion of the adoption process. [[View User Flow](https://www.figma.com/design/5i7ZlEBZ5lZg3ZQpox95Sd/Untitled?node-id=20-558&t=PRy5ZYjZ6Kicn40A-1)]

### Wireframes
We created both low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes to outline the structure and layout of key screens. [[View Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/design/5i7ZlEBZ5lZg3ZQpox95Sd/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=PRy5ZYjZ6Kicn40A-1)]

### Prototypes
Interactive prototypes were developed to demonstrate user interactions and app functionality. [[View Prototypes](https://www.figma.com/design/5i7ZlEBZ5lZg3ZQpox95Sd/Untitled?node-id=84-1011&t=PRy5ZYjZ6Kicn40A-1)]
